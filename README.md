## QTC

A personal collection of UI components

#### Motivation

I wanted to build a personal set of reusable UI components to use across projects without the use of a framework. Naturally, web components seem to be the ideal technology for my case as they are supported in all major browsers. I found LitElement after some research and it seems to be a highly efficient way to build web components.

#### Installation

Clone the repo and then install dependencies

```
npm install
```

Start developing

```
npm start
```
